# Fifth Time

## This time around

- [x] Setup FE - vite, tailwindcss, shadcn, lucide, added favicon and tab text, removed template text
- [x] Setup BE - venv, fastapi, uvicorn, openai, dotenv, added get healthcheck and post, cors, .env
- [x] Connected git
- [ ] Add FE component
- [ ] Connect BE to OpenAI

## Notes

- don't need to memorize FE setup, shadcn installation guide is fast enough
- forgot the path as part of @app.POST("path")
